    <section> 
        <p>Trebuchet MS is a web safe sans serif font. It was created in 1996 for the Microsoft Corporation.
            The name Trebuchet comes from the French word for a type of catapult. The designer of the font
            intended for it to act like a catapult that launches words across the Internet.

        <p>Trebuchet has four weights, as well as smallcaps for each weight.
        Each weight affects characters differently, and in some cases, changes 
        the letterform entirely.</p>
